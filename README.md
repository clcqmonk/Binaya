Dear Friends & Partners,

At BDMS Community Services, our values – Quality, Choice, Control, Equality, Respect, and Dignity – aren’t just ideas. They’re the heartbeat of everything we do.

Since 2019, we’ve been honored to support the Darwin & Sydney communities – because everyone, everywhere, deserves care that empowers them.

As an NDIS-registered provider, we focus on personalized support for people with mental and physical disabilities. Our team is specially trained to work with participants with high behavioral needs (BOC), and we never compromise on compassion.

To our stakeholders: Thank you for walking this journey with us. Together, we’re creating a world where dignity isn’t a privilege – it’s a promise.

With gratitude,
Binaya k Sharma
Founder & Director
